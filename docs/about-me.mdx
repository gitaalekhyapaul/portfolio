:::info Hello There!  
Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Gita Alekhya Paul**, a graduate student from SRMIST Kattankulathur. I have majored in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Cyber Security. I am a security nerd at heart, and believe in the potential for seamless UX in Web3 systems, enabling self-sovereignty of funds and intents back to the general public.

I've started my journey as an electronics enthusiast, building robots and gizmos, going to science exhibitions from an early age. From there on, during my tenure in SRMIST, I have worked with information security, server management, wireless mesh networks, IoT networks, cloud infrastructure, backend web development, and eventually moving to Web3 technologies. I had started my journey on the Zilliqa ecosystem, now gradually moving into the Ethereum ecosystem.

I am a core believer in innovating for the future, **one commit at a time**, which has led me to acquire prestigious internships, externships and fellowships like the GitHub Externship, MLH Fellowship and the MITACS Globalink Internship, just to name a few. Currently, I am focusing on improving the Web3 usability for non-native users and improving the security for them.

I am a 4x published author, and most of my research has been revolving around how we can scale distributed computing systems using blockchain technology. I am a big fan of wireless mesh technology, and have spent a considerable time in my undergraduate researching them, and developing systems to scale them efficiently over large distances.

Over the past few years, in my time as a full-time engineer, I have explored deep into enabling seamless UX for non-native users using key abstraction, chain abstraction and account abstraction. Additional to that, I am exploring on-chain data analytics, and using user interactions to train and facilitate agentic transactions using AI agents created by fine-tuning LLMs.

Actively looking for Masters/PhD supervisors in the field of blockchain and security.
