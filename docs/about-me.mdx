:::info Hello There!  
Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Gita Alekhya Paul, a Computer Science graduate from SRMIST Kattankulathur, specialized in Cyber Security. Iâ€™m a security nerd at heart and a firm believer in the promise of seamless Web3 UXâ€”enabling self-sovereignty over funds and intents for everyday users.

My journey began with building robots and electronics for science exhibitions. That early curiosity evolved at SRMIST into hands-on experience with information security, wireless mesh and IoT networks, server management, cloud infrastructure, backend systems, and eventually, Web3. I started in the Zilliqa ecosystem and now actively work in the Ethereum space.

I believe in building the future one commit at a time, which has led me to internships and fellowships like the GitHub Externship, MLH Fellowship, and MITACS Globalink Internship. My current focus lies in improving Web3 usability and security for non-native users.

As a 4x published author, my research centers on scaling distributed systems with blockchainâ€”especially using wireless mesh networks. Iâ€™ve spent years developing scalable, decentralized infrastructure across hardware and software.

In my time as a full-time engineer, Iâ€™ve worked on smart accounts, key and chain abstraction, and real-time analytics to support user-centric UX. Lately, Iâ€™m specializing in agent orchestration and on-chain cryptoeconomic systems for AI agent collaborationâ€”training LLM-powered agents that interact securely and autonomously on-chain.

Iâ€™m actively looking for Masters/PhD supervisors in blockchain and security. If youâ€™re working in this space, letâ€™s connect.
