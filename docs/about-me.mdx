:::info Hello There!  
Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Gita Alekhya Paul**, a graduate student from SRMIST Kattankulathur. I am majored in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Cyber Security.

I've started my journey as an electronics enthusiast, building robots and gizmos, going to science exhibitions from an early age. From there on, during my tenure in SRMIST, I have worked with information security, server management, wireless mesh networks, IoT networks, cloud infrastructure, backend web development, and eventually moving to Web3 technologies. I had started my journey on the Zilliqa ecosystem, now gradually moving into Ethereum.

I am a core believer in innovating for the future, **one commit at a time**, which has led me to acquire prestigious internships, externships and fellowships like the GitHub Externship, MLH Fellowship and the MITACS Globalink Internship, just to name a few. Currently, I am focusing on improving the Web3 usability for non-native users and improving the security for non-technical users.

Actively looking for PhD supervisors in the field of blockchain and security.
